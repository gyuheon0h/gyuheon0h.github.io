        <p>Hey! I'm Gyuheon, a CS student at Rice University</p>

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I enjoy all things building. I came into university as a pre-med, but switched after 
          my first year after having a blast in Rice's introductory CS class. Ever since then, I've had the pleasure of
          interning at LinkedIn and Datadog, and now am working at Watershed. Apart from work, I enjoy bouldering (currently climbing around v5),
          hiking (I love the PNW), and raving (catch me at Martin Garrix SF and Northcoast 24!).   
        </p>

            <h3>Watershed</h3>
            <p>May 2024 - Present</p>
            <p>We identify the carbon footprint of our customer's whole supply chain. More to come on this.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Datadog</h3>
            <p>May 2023 - August 2023</p>
            <p>I interned on the Historical Metrics Intake team. We were the first POC from customers who would send us timeseries data points from their services. We
              received those points, buffered them, processed them by performing rollups and aggregations, and stored them as object files for downstream teams to query from.
              I worked in some Scala and Python for our processing jobs and workflow orchestration code. However, I joined in the middle of a migration where we implemented a new Rust based timeseries database
              to buffer the points as we received them, so I got to touch a lot of Rust for the duration of the internship.

            <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
            <p>January 2023 - April 2023</p>
            <p>I interned on the Frame (feathr is the open source version, linked <a href="https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr" target="_blank">here</a>) feature store team. 
              A feature store offers ML engineers a unified platform to define features within the same name space, perform tranformations on features such aggregations and derivations, 
              and share those transformation across the whole company, Here, I mainly worked on spearheading a new feature definition 
              method. I worked in a lot of Java and some Typescript.</p>
