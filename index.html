        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I enjoy all things building. Interestingly enough, I came into university as a pre-med, but switched after 
          my first year because of how interesting I thought Rice's introductory CS class was. Ever since then, I've had the pleasure of
          interning at LinkedIn and Datadog, and now am working at Watershed. Apart from work, I enjoy bouldering (currently climbing around v5),
          hiking (I love the PMW), and raving (catch me at Martin Garrix SF and Northcoast 24!).
